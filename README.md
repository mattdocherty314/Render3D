# 3D Rendering Engine
## Overview
This is a 3D Rendering Program, made in the Processing3 Language Environment. I was inspired to create it after hearing that one of the uses for matrix multiplication was 3D rendering. 

## Depenencies
* Processing3 (tested with v3.3.2 rev0259))

## Debugging
This program has been tested on Processing 3.3.2 revision 0259 without any issues.
If you run into any errors please make sure you are on this version because it is
known to work. If you still are having issues on the aforementioned version, just
send me a message on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mattdocherty314).

## Program Use
When the program is launched, you will have to wait while it renders the scene
where there are two cubes, one floating, by a cube space, above the other.
It renders it using the CPU, which makes it really slow to render. If using an
Intel Core (8th Gen), i7-8700, it will take approximately 2 seconds. It is
dependent on single core performance.

## Version History
### v1.0.0
* Added the base program

## TODO
* Make into an executeable
* Better comments in code
* Occlusion
* Change to textured (rather than wireframe)
* Integrate GPU use
* Optimisation
* Add more controls
	* Pitch, Yaw
	* Zoom
	* XYZ Axis Movement
